# md6-weather-dash

## Description 

This webpage uses JavaScript and [OpenWeather's Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to allow a user to search for a city and see the current weather and time, as well as a 5-day forecast. Upon going to the application's URL, the user will be presented with the following page: ![Screenshot-empty-page](assets/images/empty.png)

Upon searching for a city, the aforementioned components will be displayed, and a button for a quick search will be displayed: ![Screenshot-search-example](assets/images/search.png)

By finishing this project, I was able to become more comfortable using a server-end API, fetching, and using API keys.
